              <p id="">
                Backstroke or back crawl is one of the four
                swimming styles used in competitive events 
                regulated by FINA, and the only one of these
                styles swum on the back. This swimming style
                has the advantage of easy breathing, but the
                disadvantage of swimmers not being able to 
                see where they are going

            <p id="">
              Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer
              is on their chest and the torso does not rotate.
              It is the most popular recreational style due to
              the swimmer's head being out of the water a large 
              portion of the time, and that it can be swum comfortably at slow speeds.
